# Domain Adaptation for Change Detection for Deforestation Detection on Amazon and Cerrado

ELE2006 final project

Main objective: Create a deep architecture to execute a domain adaptation using unlabeled samples from a target domain in order to assess change detection for deforestation detection on Amazon and Cerrado biomes.

 Specific Objectives: 
 - Adapt the DeepLab V3+ Architecture with the Unsupervised Domain Adaptation by Backpropagation (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.7495.pdf)
 - Compare results with baseline (lower bound and upper bound)
